## Introduction
This project was completed as Part of Year Two of BSC Software Engineering at the University of Northampton.

It was part of the module CSY2061 - Mobile Application 1 and was an assessment of the student's ability to learn the basics of Android Studio, and how they apply the previous year's Java knowledge to developing basic Mobile Applications.

This project was weighted for 50% of the module grade. The other 50% is uploaded in a separate repository under the same module name.

The main aim of this project was to show the author's skill development since the last Mobile Application Assignment (AS1). In this assignment, the Author not only had  to show refined skills but also the ability to connect the platform to a Database and access data within that. 
The Database was built using SQLite. 

The main aim of this application was to create a Skeleton Application that demonstrates how a user may start to develop a Social Media App. 
To simplify this application the task focused on the Time Line aspect of Social Media Applications. 

While there were marks for basic UI, there were no marks for using assets or images in the application. Therefore this application is a Skeleton Application.

## Brief (Summarised)
Design, implement and test an application that allows users to register for an application that allows users to post comments. The system should enable users to register. Here are the specific requirements:

- Basic System Requirements
  - Register for the application (Full name, Email Address, Date Registered, Date Updated, Password etc)
  - Login into the application
  - Update user profile
  - When updating the profile page, the Date Updated column should be updated to show the user when they last updated their profile details
  - All registered users should be able to access the General Timeline activity. Whilst on the General Timeline activity, users should be able to do the following:
  - Post a comment for all registered users in the application to see
  - When a user posts, the post should show the date of the post and the name of the user who posted.

- Enhancements (in order of importance – high to low):
  - All registered users should be able to access My Timeline activity
  - The My Timeline activity should show all the posts for the user who is currently logged into the application. 
  - All the posts must show the date of the post. 
  - The registered user should be able to delete any of their posts 
  - The registered user should be able to update any of the posts
  - An administrator should be able to log into the application 
  - The administrator should be able to view all the registered users
  - The administrator should be able to delete users
  - When a registered user’s account is deleted, their posts should also be deleted.
  - The administrator should be able to export all users to a file. 

These additional features are only suggestions and are not exhaustive. You may include any other useful features relevant to this application. You need to clarify/extract more detailed requirements from the tutor and are encouraged to use an agile methodology for software development.
